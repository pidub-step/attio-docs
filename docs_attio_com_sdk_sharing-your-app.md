# Sharing your app
How to share or publish your app
You can share your app privately, and optionally publish it to the Attio AppStore. We’ll cover both ways of sharing your app here and when to use them.
## 
[​](https://docs.attio.com/sdk/sharing-your-app#sharing-your-app-privately)
Sharing your app privately
This is a good option if you’ve built an app for your own use (and if using the App SDK want to install it in a different workplace to which you used for developing it), or if you’re working with a few companies using Attio and have built an app for them.
You can get a shareable link that anyone with it can use to install your app.
Head over to the [Developer dashboard](https://build.attio.com), select your app, and click the three dots overflow menu.

Then select Share.
Copy the link and share it.

Publishing your app
This is a good option if you’d like to make your app available to all Attio users. It will be listed in the [Attio App Store](https://app.attio.com/_/settings/apps) both inside the Attio product and on the attio.com homepage.
Publishing your app requires a review from the Attio team which can take up to 2 business days.
Once your done building your app and are ready to publish it, head over to the [developer dashboard](https://build.attio.com).
Ensure you have a complete App Listing (note: you’ll want to review our [design guidelines](https://docs.attio.com/sdk/design-guidelines) as you add your icon and app screenshots).
Once you’re ready, hit publish.
Once you Publish your app, the Attio team will begin reviewing it to ensure it meets our app quality and UX standards. Within 2 business days we will complete our review and either approve your app or provide feedback on what changes you need to make to get approved.
