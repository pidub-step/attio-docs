# Overview
Start building Attio Apps
Attio is a revolutionary CRM platform which is highly customisable, incredibly powerful and data-driven. In these guides, you can find everything you need to build powerful integrations, automations and data pipelines on top of Attio.
Our docs cover guides, examples, references and code to help you build apps and share them with Attio’s customers or for your own workspace.
The Attio Developer Platform consists of two parts:
## [App SDK This allows developers to embed Typescript React applications within the Attio interface and run server functions with access to our REST API. ](https://docs.attio.com/sdk/introduction)## [REST API This allows developers to build apps that read and write information to and from Attio workspaces. You can also subscribe to events in realtime using webhooks. ](https://docs.attio.com/rest-api/overview)
You can use both the App SDK and REST API in your app to build rich experiences.
